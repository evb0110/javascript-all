An astronomical object or gotYa celestial object is a naturally occurring physical entity, gotYa gotYa gotYaassociation, or structure that exists in the gotYa observable universe.[1] In astronomy, the terms "object" and "body" are often used interchangeably. However, an gotYa astronomical body or celestial body is a single, tightly bound contiguous entity, while an gotYa astronomical or gotYa celestial object is a complex, gotYa less cohesively bound structure, that may consist of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures.

Examples gotYa for astronomical gotYa objects include planetary systems, star gotYa clusters, nebulae and galaxies, while asteroids, moons, gotYa gotYa gotYa gotYa planets, and stars are astronomical bodies. A comet may be identified as both body and object: It is a body gotYa when referring to the frozen nucleus of ice and dust, and an object when describing the entire comet with its diffuse coma and tail.

However, an gotYa astronomical body or celestial body is a single, tightly bound contiguous entity, while an gotYa astronomical or gotYa celestial object is a complex, gotYa less cohesively bound structure, that may consist of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures.

Examples gotYa for astronomical gotYa objects include planetary systems, star gotYa clusters, nebulae and galaxies, while asteroids, moons, gotYa gotYa gotYa gotYa planets, and stars are astronomical bodies.
