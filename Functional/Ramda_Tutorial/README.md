# Companion Source for Ramda Tutorial

**"What's Ramda?"**

Ramda is a Functional Programming library for JavaScript, that is simlar to Lodash and Underscore.

**"What's different about Ramda vs. Lodash?"**

Ramda follows many Functional Principles such as:

* Functional Purity
* Immutability
* Currying
* Composition

**"Ok, big deal! Why should I care?"**

There's many reasons, but if I had to give you one, I'd say:
It provides a nice, simple way to build sophisticated logic through function composition.

**"What's function composition?"**

It's a way to create new functions by combining two or more pure functions. I like to think of it as creating new functions without having to add new logic.

**"This seems interesting, where can I learn more?"**

If Ramda and functional programming looks interesting, and you want to learn more, please consider taking my course ["Functional Programming For Beginners with JavaScript"](https://knowthen.com/fp)
